## What is it?
This package consists of a `WithPromiseCacheSSR` HOC and a `usePromise` hook.
With this package you can achieve SSR data fetching on component level without having to (pre)fetch in getInitialProps.

This function walks down the entire React tree and executes every required promise it encounters (including nested promises).

When the Promise resolves, you're ready to render your React tree and return it, along with the current state of the cache.

*Sidenote!*
This library walks down the entire React tree on SSR.
It'll run renderToStaticMarkup from ReactDOMServer. Note that this is the React SSR API and means that it does a full server-render of the whole React tree.

Note that renderToStaticMarkup is a synchronous run to completion method, meaning that it can't await promises as of right now (Suspense might solve this).

In practice though you have usePromise components deeply nested in the React tree. React can't await those as said, so this is worked around by throwing a promise every time a query is found.

When the promise is thrown that is awaited and then the rendering starts again, from the beginning of the tree.

This means that if you have nested queries you cause a lot of full server-renders.

This solution might cause you a performance overhead (and general bundle size when using Apollo is quite heavy currently). 

But try it out and see if it is a bottleneck for you!

## Usage
See the `example` folder for a full fletched example on how to use this.

In your Custom _app.tsx add the HOC:

```jsx
import { WithPromiseCacheSSR } from 'with-next-promise-tree-walker'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps)  {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default WithPromiseCacheSSR(MyApp)
```

In your component/page you need to use the `usePromise()` hook. This example uses Typescript.

```jsx
import { usePromise } from  'with-next-promise-tree-walker'

interface VercelRepos {
  name: string
  description: string
  subscribers_count: number
  stargazers_count: number
  forks_count: number
}
const fetcher = (url: string) => fetch(url).then(res => res.json());

const SomePage: React.FC = () => {
  const { isLoading, data, error } = usePromise<any>('https://api.github.com/repos/vercel/swr', fetcher, { ssr: true, skip: false });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.description}</p>
      <strong>üëÄ {data.subscribers_count}</strong>{" "}
      <strong>‚ú® {data.stargazers_count}</strong>{" "}
      <strong>üç¥ {data.forks_count}</strong>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Prior Art
The approach of doing an initial "data fetching pass" is inspired by:

- [`react-ssr-prepass`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-ssr-prepass)
- [`react-apollo`'s `getDataFromTree`](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/blob/master/src/getDataFromTree.ts)
